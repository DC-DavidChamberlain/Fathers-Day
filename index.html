        <p>You have no idea how much I look up to you!</p>

        <p>I know that you have your faults, but you truly are a great exemplar 
          of a GREAT Husband & Father, who always follows God's Word and Guidance. 
          If I am able to emulate even a fraction of what you have shown me over 
          the years, then I would be a blessed man!</p>

        <p>I am so greatful to have you as a Father! I love you!</p>
