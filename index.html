        <h2>Dad,</h2>
        <p>You have no idea how much I look up to you!</p>

        <p>I know that you have your faults, but you truly are a great exemplar 
          of a GREAT Husband & Father, who always follows God's Word and Guidance.</p> 
          <p>I am able to emulate even a fraction of what you have shown me over 
          the years, then I would be a blessed man!</p>

        <p>I am so greatful to have you as a Father! I love you!</p>

        <h2>Mom,</h2>
        <p>I am so thankful for you and everything you do for me.
          I would not be where I am or who I am today if not for you (and dad) helping shape me into the man I am.</p>

        <p>Thank you for always being patient with me, especially when I don't deserve it.
          Thank you for being full of grace for me, especially when I don't deserve it.
          And thank you for always laughing at my silly jokes... especially when I don't deserve it 🙃.</p>

        <p>I am so glad that you are my mom forever and ever! I love you!</p>
